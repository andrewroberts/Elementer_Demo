# Elementer_Demo

To provide an easy way of creating a "Settings" page in a client-side UI (dialog, app, or sidebar) of a Google Apps Script Bruce McPherson's has pulled all of the required code  into the Elementer object. There are instructions on using it on [his website][1].

There is a [standalone client-side demo on CodePen](https://codepen.io/brucemcpherson/pen/ORwgaB). 

This repo contains a simple working demo of passing values from the server (a hard-coded menu in an array), watching for changes in the menu in the UI and passing the selected value back to the server to be displayed in a spreadsheet.

The CodePen script seemed a little out of date so the Elementer object and supporting code is taken from the [SlidesMerge add-on](https://github.com/brucemcpherson/SlidesMerge).

You can try it on [this demo sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hidDtySrQxPTzHb3ETLvaYbIR_22cLVG1665WRaOREY/edit#gid=0), and take a copy to see the code.
